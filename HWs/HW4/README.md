HW4: Domain Logic and Data Source

## How this app works:

The app can be previewed on `http:localhost:8080`

### Homepage
- Allows user to add a contract with date with a product associated to it as well as a revenue

Once a contract is added, the app takes us to `/check`

### Check revenue `/check`
- Presents a form from which you can select a contract and check if revenue has been collected on a particular date
After submitting the form
  
### Result screen
- The screen shows how much revenue has been collected based on the previous inputs
